        <ul>
            <li>Apologies for the issue, but we couldn't find your data where it is supposed to be present.</li>
            <li>This is usually caused by miconfigured sync or some other really specific problems.</li>
            <li>Do not worry though, we store your data safely in two places so that, even if you don't have a
                backup, chances of your losing your data are almost nil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&#x25cf; Restore data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We found some data in these locations, and have thus saved it as a text file which you can
                download.
                <a class="local-found"></a> OR <a class="sync-found"></a> OR <a class="localstorage-found"></a>
            </li>
            <li>Now you may upload a backup file, from above or your own previously saved copy here, and we will
                load it for you.
